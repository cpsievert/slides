## Google Summer of Code

* Students propose a free and open-source software coding project to Google.
    * The R project has a number of projects that you may choose from.
* A mentoring organization (e.g., the R project) evaluates applications and decides which proposals to accept.
    * Of course, it helps if you know mentors (Susan and Yihui were both mentors this summer).
* Google decides how many projects to fund for each organization (the R project had 17 projects this summer)
* I __highly recommend__ applying (even if you plan on taking the written prelim the same summer)!

## Lessons learned

* Contributing to a mature project is really hard!

## Lessons learned

* Making contributions is easier when you have tests in place that ensure you haven't broken anything!

## What is animint?

* R package that leverages ggplot2's grammar of graphics implementation to simplify the creation of web-based interactive graphics and animations.

## Strike-zone plot with ggplot2

<div class="columns-2">
```{r strike, fig.align='left'}
library(pitchRx)
# load some data
data(pitches, package = "pitchRx") 
# create plot
p <- ggplot() +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.3, data = pitches,
             aes(px, pz, color = pitch_type)) +
  facet_grid(stand~pitcher_name) + 
  coord_equal()
# print plot
p
```
</div>

## How does animint work?

* __animint__ has two main components: a _compiler_ (the R side) and a _renderer_ (the JS side).
    * The _compiler_ extracts essential components of a _built_ ggplot object and writes them to a JSON object.
    * The _renderer_ reads the JSON object and draws the plot.
* It turns out that ggplot objects are incredibly complex, so I built [this thing](https://cpsievert.shinyapps.io/ggtree) to help me visualize the nested structure.

```{r shiny, eval=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
#In case shinyapps is down
shiny::runGitHub(repo = "shiny_apps", username = "cpsievert", subdir = "ggtree")
shiny::runApp("~/Desktop/github/local/shiny_apps/ggtree")
```

## Convert your ggplots to animint plots!

> - `animint2dir` takes a _list_ of ggplots, creates the relevant HTML/JS files and places them in a directory that can be viewed with a browser.

```{r animint2dir, eval=FALSE}
library(animint)
plist <- list(strike = p)
animint2dir(plist, "some-directory")
```

> - If you have a GitHub account, you can easily share with others by uploading the HTML/JS files [as a gist](https://gist.github.com/cpsievert/ab9767de8f26b97bf658) and viewing [the result via bl.ocks.org](http://bl.ocks.org/cpsievert/raw/ab9767de8f26b97bf658/)

```{r animint2gist, eval=FALSE}
animint2gist(plist)
```

---

> - In knitr, you can embed animint plots by attaching a class of `"animint"`

```{r lies, echo=FALSE}
library(animint)
plist <- list(strike = p)
```

<div align="center">
```{r strike-knitr}
structure(plist, class = "animint")
```
</div>


## Computing pitch trajectories with PITCHf/x

```{r getLocations}
devtools::source_gist(id = "da555f08f3c9ba2c0b8e")
locs <- getLocations(pitches, pitcher_name, pitch_type, summarise = TRUE)
head(locs)
```

> - `frame` keeps track of time since the pitcher released the ball (in thousands of a second). 
> - As `frame` becomes larger, the distance from home plate (`y`) becomes smaller.

---

```{r avg_by_plot, fig.align='center'}
p <- ggplot() + geom_point(aes(x = x, y = z, color = pitch_type, showSelected = frame), 
                            data = locs) + facet_grid(. ~ pitcher_name) + ylim(0, 7) + 
                xlim(-3, 3) + coord_equal() + xlab("") + ylab("Height from ground") 
p
```

## Simple animation

> - To convert this plot into an SVG-based animation, we'll group a few animint specific options and the plot itself into a list. 

```{r add_options}
plist <- list(strikezone = p + theme_animint(width = 800),            
              # animate over frame (remember, this also a showSelected variable)
              time = list(variable = "frame", ms = 100),
              # use smooth transitions
              duration = list(frame = 250))
```

## Simple animation

```{r animint}
structure(plist, class = "animint")
```

## From animation to interaction

* We've just used the `time` option to automatically loop through values of the `showSelected` variable `frame`.
* Instead of animating over time, we can use the `clickSelects` aesthetic to let the user select values via mouseclick.
* When used correctly, this allows one to create visualizations that reflect the popular mantra: "Overview first, zoom and filter, then details on demand"

## Overview with zoom & filter

```{r ggstrike}
# reusable components of a faceted strike-zone plot
ggstrike <- function() {
  ggplot() + facet_grid(pitcher_name ~ stand) +
  ylim(0, 7) + xlim(-3, 3) + coord_equal() + xlab("") + 
  ylab("")
}
# overview (not filtered by anything)
strike <- ggstrike() + theme(legend.position = "none") +
      geom_point(data = pitches, aes(x = px, y = pz, color = pitch_type))
# filter by date
strike_date <- ggstrike() + geom_point(data = pitches, aes(x = px, y = pz, color = pitch_type, 
                                        showSelected = date))
```

---

Another plot is required to select dates via a mouseclick. Here we create a time series of the number of pitches thrown (by pitch_type and pitcher_name) and add transparent vertical bars that one may click on to select different dates:

```{r zoom-filter}
# track the number of pitches per game (for each pitcher-type combination)
library(dplyr)
n_pitches <- pitches %>% group_by(pitch_type, pitcher_name, date) %>% summarise(count = n()) %>% 
  mutate(group = paste(pitcher_name, pitch_type, sep = ": ")) %>%
  mutate(dated = as.Date(date, format = "%Y_%m_%d")) %>%
  data.frame %>% mutate(max_n = max(count))

# time series plot with clickSelects
series <- ggplot() + 
  geom_line(aes(x = dated, y = count, colour = pitch_type, 
                linetype = pitcher_name, group = group), data = n_pitches) + 
  stat_identity(aes(x = dated, y = max_n, clickSelects = date, alpha = 0.2), 
                geom = "bar", data = n_pitches) + scale_alpha(guide = 'none') +
  xlab("") + ylab("Number of pitches") + theme_animint(width = 800, height = 200)

plist2 <- list(strike = strike, strikeDate = strike_date, series = series)
```

---

```{r, echo=FALSE}
structure(plist2, class = "animint")
```

## Details on demand

> - Instead of averaging pitch trajectories, let's get the trajectory of every pitch!

```{r int-ani}
locs2 <- getLocations(pitches, pitcher_name, pitch_type, date, end_speed, summarise = FALSE) %>%
  mutate(end_speed = paste0("End Speed: ", end_speed, " MPH"))
head(locs2)
```

---

```{r lab, echo=FALSE}
pitches$pitch_id <- seq_len(dim(pitches)[1])
```

```{r label}
strike2 <- ggstrike() + theme(legend.position = "none") +
  geom_point(data = pitches, aes(x = px, y = pz, color = pitch_type, 
### <b>                                 
              showSelected = date, clickSelects = pitch_id))
### </b>  

ani <- ggplot() + 
  geom_point(aes(x = x, y = z, color = pitch_type, 
### <b>
                  showSelected = pitch_id, showSelected2 = frame), 
### </b>
             data = locs2) + 
  geom_text(aes(x = 0, y = 7, label = end_speed, 
### <b>
                showSelected = pitch_id, showSelected2 = frame),
### </b>
            data = locs2) + 
  ylim(0, 7) + xlim(-3, 3) + coord_equal() + xlab("") + 
  ylab("Height from ground")

plist3 <- list(strike2 = strike2,
               ani = ani,
               series = series,
               time = list(variable = "frame", ms = 100),
               duration = list(frame = 250))
```

---

```{r, echo=FALSE}
structure(plist3, class = "animint")
```
