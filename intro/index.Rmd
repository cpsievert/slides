# With your neighbor, list some things R _is_ and _does_

### R is ...
### R does ...

## R is ...

* __Free__ to use
* __Extensible__
    * Over 7300 user contributed add-on packages currently on CRAN!
* __Powerful__
    * With the right tools, get more work done, faster.
* __Flexible__
    * Not a question of _can_, but _how_.
* __Frustrating__
    * Flexibility comes at a cost (easy to shoot yourself in the foot!).

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
# devtools::install_github("metacran/crandb")
# pkgs <- crandb::list_packages(limit = 999999)
# length(pkgs)
# [1] 7330
```

## R does ...

* __Graphics, statistics, machine learning, etc.__
* __Data acquisition, munging, management__
* __Literate programming (dynamic reports)__
* __Web applications__

(This roughly serves as our outline)

## Some Basics

* Combine values into a vector with `c()`

```{r}
c(0, 1)
```

* Assign values to a name with `<-` (or `=`)

```{r}
x <- c(0, 1)
```

* Avoid `for` loops and use built-in _vectorized_ functions

```{r}
sum(x + 10)
```

* Although arcane at times, `R` has rich support for documentation, see `?sum`

---

* Use `[` to extract elements of a vector.

```{r}
c("a", "b")[1]
c("a", "b")[c(T, F)]
```

* Extract _named_ elements with `$`, `[[`, and/or `[`

```{r}
x <- list(
  a = 10,
  b = c(1, "2")
)
x$a
x[["a"]]
x["a"]
```

## Examining 'structure'

* `str()` is probably my favorite `R` function. It shows you the "structure" of _any_ R object (and _everything_ in R is an object!!!)

```{r}
str(x)
```

* Lists are heterogenous (elements can have different types)
* Vectors are homogenous (elements have the same type)
    * That's why `c(1, "2")` ends up being a character string.

* If you'd like to know more, see Hadley Wickham's online chapters on [data structures](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Data-structures.html) and [subsetting](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Subsetting.html)

## Getting Help

* Reading documentation only gets you so far. What about _finding_ function(s) and/or package(s) to help solve a problem???

* Google! (I usually prefix "CRAN" to my search; others might suggest <http://www.rseek.org/>)

* Ask your question on a relevant StackExchange outlet such as  <http://stackoverflow.com/> or <http://stats.stackexchange.com/>

* It's becoming more and more popular to bundle "vignettes" with a package (__dplyr__ has _awesome_ vignettes)

```{r, eval = FALSE}
browseVignettes("dplyr")
```

## Some Oddities

* Yes, `+` is a function (which calls compiled C code)

```{r}
`+`
```

* What's that? You don't like addition? Me neither!

```{r}
"+" <- function(x, y) "I forgot how to add"
1 + 2
```

* But seriously, don't "overload operators" unless you know what you're doing

```{r}
rm("+")
```

## Obligatory economics example

```{r}
data(economics, package = "ggplot2")
# data frames are essentially a list of vectors
str(economics)
```

> - __Your Turn__: Read the documentation for `economics`. Can you think of a interesting/informative function of these variable(s)?

## Hello ggplot2

```{r, fig.height = 3, fig.width = 10}
library(ggplot2)
p <- ggplot(economics, aes(date, unemploy / pop)) + 
  geom_line()
p
```

## Hello Linear/Additive Models!

```{r, fig.show = 'hold'}
p
p + geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = F)
p + geom_smooth(method = "loess", se = F)
p + geom_smooth(method = "gam", formula = y ~ s(x, bs = "cr"), se = F)
```

## How does `geom_smooth()` work?

```{r}
m <- lm((unemploy / pop) ~ date, data = economics)
str(m)
```

---

```{r, fig.height = 3, fig.width = 10}
economics$yhat <- m$fitted.values
ggplot(economics) + 
  geom_line(aes(date, unemploy / pop)) +
  geom_line(aes(date, yhat), color = "blue")
```

> - __Your Turn__: Make the loess smoother plot without `geom_smooth()` (hint: convert `date` to a numeric vector with `as.numeric()` and use `loess()`). For a solution, see [here](https://github.com/cpsievert/slides/blob/gh-pages/intro/yourTurn1.R)

## Time Series Analysis

* `R` has a ton of support for time series analysis (see the [Task View](https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/TimeSeries.html)). 

* To create a time series (aka `"ts"`) object, use the `ts()` function

```{r}
r <- ts(economics$unemploy / economics$pop)
str(r)
class(r)
ar1 <- arima(r, order = c(1, 0, 0))
class(ar1)
```

---

```{r}
str(predict(ar1))
```

* From `?predict`:
    * `predict()` is a _generic function_ for predictions from the results of various model fitting functions. The function invokes particular _methods_ which depend on the class of the first argument.

* Since `class(ar1)` is `"Arima"`, `predict(ar1)` calls `predict.Arima()`.

* Base R comes with a bunch of prediction methods, and add-on packages can easily add new prediction methods for new classes.

---

```{r}
methods(predict)
```

---

`summary()` is another useful generic function. Turns out `summary.Arima()` doesn't exist in base `R`, but the __forecast__ package provides one for us %^)

```{r}
library(forecast)
summary(ar1)
```

---

```{r}
methods(summary)
```

---

**Your Turn**: 

> - Have a look over `?predict` and `?predict.Arima`. Forecast 10 steps ahead using the `ar1` model. See [here](https://github.com/cpsievert/slides/blob/gh-pages/intro/yourTurn2.R) for a solution.
> - Have a look over `?forecast` and `?forecast.Arima`. How is `predict.Arima()` different from `forecast.Arima()`?
> - **Warning**: Solution is on the next page, are you sure you want to continue?

---

The `forecast()` function in the __forecast__ package makes it easy to construct and plot prediction intervals.

```{r}
forecast(ar1, level = 95)
```

---

```{r, fig.height = 5.5, fig.width = 10}
plot(forecast(ar1, level = 95))
```

---

**Your Turn**: Can you reconstruct `plot(forecast(ar1, level = 95))` using __ggplot2__? Here are some hints:

* `as.data.frame(forecast(ar1, level = 95))` gives you the forecast data. Modify the column names so they don't have spaces (see `?names`).
* You'll need the corresponding forecast dates. See `?seq.Date` for creating a sequence of dates.
* `geom_ribbon()` is helpful for plotting the uncertainty.

See [here](https://gist.github.com/cpsievert/62d6f5ddcdb923324e2a) for a solution

```{r}
# to run the your turn solution...
devtools::source_gist("62d6f5ddcdb923324e2a")
```

## Interactive and web-based!

```{r, cache = FALSE}
library(plotly)
ggplotly(p)
```

## Reshaping data

<div align="center">
  <img src="reshape.png" width="900" height="500">
</div>

---

```{r, echo = FALSE}
data(economics)
```


```{r}
head(economics)
```

```{r}
library(tidyr)
e <- gather(economics, variable, value, -date)
head(e)
```

---

```{r, fig.height = 5.5, fig.width = 10}
ggplot(e, aes(date, value)) + geom_line() +
  facet_wrap(~ variable, scales = "free_y")
```

## Pure functional programming


Pure functions _modify_ a central object-type (e.g., input a data frame and output another data frame)

__Your turn__: Have we encountered any 'pure' function(s)? Can you think of any other pure functions?

## Pure functions in base R


```{r}
subset(
  transform(
    economics,
    year = format(date, "%Y")
  ),
  year == 2000
)
```

---

<div align = "center">
  <img src="pure.jpeg" width="900" height="300" />
</div>

---

__magrittr's__ `%>%` operator makes it much easier to read a sequence of pure manipulations

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(magrittr)
economics %>%
  transform(year = format(date, "%Y")) %>%
  subset(year == 2000)
```

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# in general, this:
f(g(x), y) 
# equal this
x %>% g() %>% f(y)
```

> - `%>%` allows us to read left -> right (instead of inside -> out)

## dplyr: A consistent grammar of data manipulation

```{r}
library(dplyr)
economics %>%
  mutate(year = format(date, "%Y")) %>%
  filter(year == 2000)
```

## Split-apply-combine in dplyr

```{r}
economics %>%
  mutate(year = format(date, "%Y")) %>%
  group_by(year) %>%
  summarise(mpce = mean(pce))
```

## Your Turn

Find the average annual personal savings rate (`psavert`)

<ul class="build">
```{r}
economics %>%
  mutate(year = format(date, "%Y")) %>%
  group_by(year) %>%
  summarise(mpce = mean(psavert))
```
</ul>


## A new example: babynames

```{r}
library(babynames)
head(babynames)
dim(babynames)
```

## Write/read csv (or other flat files)

```{r, cache = TRUE}
library(readr)
bb_path <- tempfile(fileext = ".csv")
write_csv(babynames, bb_path)
read_csv(bb_path)
```

## Get other formats into R

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(readxl)
read_excel("my-spreadsheet.xls", sheet = "data")
read_excel("my-spreadsheet.xls", sheet = 2)
```

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(haven)
# SAS files
read_sas("path/to/file")
# SPSS files
read_por("path/to/file")
read_sav("path/to/file")
# Stata files
read_dta("path/to/file")
```

## dplyr loves databases

```{r, eval = FALSE}
db <- src_sqlite("intro/babynames.sqlite3", create = TRUE)
copy_to(db, babynames, temporary = FALSE)
```

```{r, echo = FALSE, cache = FALSE}
db <- src_sqlite("babynames.sqlite3")
```

```{r}
db
tbl(db, "babynames")
```

## Send computation to the data

```{r}
h <- db %>% 
  tbl("babynames") %>%
  filter(name == "Hilary")
```

```{r}
class(h)
h$query
# execute SQL query and bring into R
hc <- collect(h)
class(hc)
hc
```

---

```{r, fig.height = 3, fig.width = 10, cache = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
plot_ly(hc, x = year, y = prop, color = sex, colors = c("blue", "hotpink"))
```

---

```{r}
popular <- babynames %>%
  group_by(name) %>%
  summarise(N = sum(n)) %>%
  arrange(desc(N))
popular
```

---

```{r}
top <- top_n(popular, 1000)
topnames <- subset(babynames, name %in% top[["name"]])
topnames
```

---

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(shiny)
library(ggplot2)
ui <- bootstrapPage(
  selectizeInput(
    inputId = 'name', 
    label = 'Enter a name', 
    choices = unique(topnames$name),
    selected = "James",
    multiple = TRUE
  ),
  plotOutput('plot')
)
server <- function(input, output) {
  output$plot <- renderPlot({ 
    dat <- subset(topnames, name %in% input$name)
    ggplot(dat, aes(year, prop, colour = sex)) + 
      geom_line() + facet_wrap(~ name)
  })
}
runApp(shinyApp(ui, server))
```
