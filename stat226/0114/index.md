Motivating statistics
========================================================

* __I'll be honest: stats _can_ be hard/boring!__
  * As in many fields, you have to work hard and learn (sometimes boring) things before you can do the fun stuff!
* __BUT, it's _not_ irrelevant:__
  * __Google__ uses statistics to optimize search results.
  * __Netflix__ uses statistics to makes suggestions based on your viewing history.
  * __Facebook__ uses statistics to study human behavior and the dynamics of social networks.
  * __The government__ uses statistics to track down terriorists!
