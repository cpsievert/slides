Announcements
========================================================

* "Quiz" 1 is available on Blackboard and is due Sunday (it's just a survey).
* Homework 1 is now available on Blackboard and is due next week Thursday.
* My office hours will be on Mondays at 12:00-1:50pm in Snedecor 1205.
  * Except for this upcoming Monday (MLK Day).
  * The full office hours schedule is up on Blackboard.
* Any questions about the syllabus, Chapter 1 or Chapter 2?

K-Packs Example
========================================================
title:false

* __Question__: How much should KPacks charge for their backpack? More specifically, what is the average amount potential customers are willing to spend?
* __Population__:
  * Potential customers.
* __Sample__:
  * Fall 2013 STAT 226 section D students (in your case...your neighbors).
* __Parameter__:
  * The __average (or mean)__ amount potential customers are willing to pay.
* __Statistic__:
  * The __average (or mean)__ amount fall 2013 STAT 226 section D students (in your case...your neighbors) are willing to pay.
  
Digging Deeper
========================================================

* A population and sample _could_ be any size that you wish...it really all depends on your question of interest.
  * However, your sample _must_ be a subset of your population. That is, your sample should __never__ contain something outside of your population.
  * Is this the case for the KPacks example???
  * Well, that probably depends on your definition of potential customer...
  * Even if everyone here is a potential customer, would this class be a _good_ representation of all potential customers?
  * No, this is a case of __convenience__ sampling. The __statistic__ is probably not a good estimate of the __parameter__!
  
Diagram to Identify Variable Types
========================================================

<div align="center"><img src="variables.png" width="800" height="500"/></div>

* What type of __variable__ is in the K-Packs example?
* Let's get more practice with a worksheet

Random Variables...
========================================================

* What is a __random__ variable? In other words, what makes a variable __random__? (Hint: the answer is quite simple)
  * If we have __not observed__ the variable, then it is random!
  * A random variable represents our __belief__ about __possible values__.
  * In general, capital letters denote a random variable and lower case letters denote an observed value.
  * For example, let x be the number of beers I consumed last night and X be the number of beers I consume this Friday.
  * With this framework, I can say: "What is the chance (or probability) that the # of beers I consume this Friday is larger than what I consumed last night?"

Processes
========================================================
incremental: false

* Fundamental to many business decisions. For example, monthly sales at company X is a process.
* Predicting future sales can be incredibly difficult. In stat 326, you'll learn how to forecast.

Time Series Data
========================================================
title: false

* The graphic below contains similar __time series__ data on monthly sales. What's the difference?

* Is one graphic better than the other?
* Quality is a matter of context (and sometimes preference). There is an entire field focused on these problems!

Data Visualization
========================================================

There is more than one way to represent the same [data](http://www.nanocubes.net/view.html).

Misleading graphs
========================================================

* Take away: Don't mislead your audience!

What's a 226 student to do?
========================================================

1. Identify the __variable__ of interest.
2. Identify whether the variable is __categorical__ or __quantitative__.
3. If variable is __categorical__ (chapter 3), you're options are:
  * __Bar chart__ (recommended)
  * __Pareto chart__ (recommended)
  * __Pie chart__ (not recommended)
4. If variable is __quantitative__ (chapter 4), you're options are:
  * <div title="distribution of a variable is the collection of possible values the
variable can take and how often each value occurs." style="float:left;clear:both;">__Histogram__ (good for examining a single __distribution__)</div>
  * __Boxplot__ (good for comparing multiple __distributions__)
